# Skyfall - Falling Blocks Game
This is a simple Unity game where the player has to dodge falling blocks. This project is based off [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vov9H7RuF8). I did this project to get more familiar with the basics of Unity because who doesn't want to make games!

**Features**
- Randomly sized squares of different sizes fall from randomized directions
- The amount of blocks spawned and the speed at which they fall increases in relation to time
- When the player gets hit by a block, a screen showing the time the player survived along with a prompt to play again is displayed
